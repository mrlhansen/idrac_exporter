# This is an example configuration file for the iDRAC exporter,
# including default values and equivalent environment variables.
# The environment variables take precedence over the values in
# the configuration file.
# Environment variables can also be referenced in the configuration
# file using the syntax ${MY_VARIABLE}

# Listen address
# Default value: 0.0.0.0
# Environment variable CONFIG_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0
address: 0.0.0.0

# Listen port
# Default value: 9348
# Environment variable CONFIG_PORT=9348
port: 9348

# HTTP timeout in seconds for Redfish API calls
# Default value: 10
# Environment variable CONFIG_TIMEOUT=10
timeout: 10

# Prefix for the exported metrics
# Default value: idrac
# Environment variable CONFIG_METRICS_PREFIX=idrac
metrics_prefix: idrac

# Enable the use of an https proxy for all requests
# Environment variable: HTTPS_PROXY=http://localhost:8888
https_proxy: http://localhost:8888

# The TLS section is used to enable HTTPS for the exporter. To enable TLS you
# need a PEM encoded certificate and private key. The public certificate must
# include the entire chain of trust.
# TLS can also be configured using the corresponding environment variables.
tls:
  enabled: false  # CONFIG_TLS_ENABLED=false
  cert_file: ""   # CONFIG_TLS_CERT_FILE=
  key_file: ""    # CONFIG_TLS_KEY_FILE=

# The hosts section is used to define login information for the different targets.
# Hosts can be referenced either via their IP address or their hostname, as long
# as it matches the "target" parameter when scraping the metrics. Optionally you
# can also specify a scheme (http or https) for accessing the Redfish API, which
# automatically defaults to https. You can also specify a custom port if the server
# is not using the default port (443 for https, 80 for http).
#
# The option "use_basic_auth" can be used to disable session authentication (which
# is used by default) and always use HTTP basic auth. This is NOT recommended and
# it should only be used if there is an actual reason.
#
# When the "target" does not match any host, the exporter will attempt to use the
# login information under "default". The information in the default section can also
# be configured using environment variables, but this is not possible for any of the
# other targets.
hosts:
  default:
    username: user         # CONFIG_DEFAULT_USERNAME=user
    password: pass         # CONFIG_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=pass
    scheme: https          # CONFIG_DEFAULT_SCHEME=https
    port: 8443             # CONFIG_DEFAULT_PORT=8443
    use_basic_auth: true   # CONFIG_DEFAULT_USE_BASIC_AUTH=true
  192.168.1.1:

# The metrics section is used to select different groups of metrics.
# See the README file for a detailed list of metrics in each group.
# Each section can also be enabled using the shown environment variable.
# The group "all" overrides all other groups and enables all metrics.

# The events section is used for filtering events when the "events" metrics group
# is enabled. Events can be filtered based on minimum severity and maximum age.
# Severity must be one of "ok", "warning", "critical"
events:
  severity: warning  # CONFIG_EVENTS_SEVERITY=warning

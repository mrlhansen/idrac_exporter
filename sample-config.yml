# This is a sample configuration file for the iDRAC exporter,
# including default values and equivalent environment variables.
# The environment variables take precedence over the values in
# the configuration file.

# Listen address
# Default value: 0.0.0.0
# Environment variable CONFIG_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0
address: 0.0.0.0

# Listen port
# Default value: 9348
# Environment variable CONFIG_PORT=9348
port: 9348

# HTTP timeout in seconds for Redfish API calls
# Default value: 10
# Environment variable CONFIG_TIMEOUT=10
timeout: 10

# Prefix for the exported metrics
# Default value: idrac
# Environment variable CONFIG_METRICS_PREFIX=idrac
metrics_prefix: idrac

# Enable the use of an https proxy for all requests
# Environment variable: HTTPS_PROXY=http://localhost:8888
https_proxy: http://localhost:8888

# The TLS section is used to enable HTTPS for the exporter. To enable TLS you
# need a PEM encoded certificate and private key. The public certificate must
# include the entire chain of trust.
# TLS can also be configured using the corresponding environment variables.
tls:
  enabled: false  # CONFIG_TLS_ENABLED=false
  cert_file: ""   # CONFIG_TLS_CERT_FILE=
  key_file: ""    # CONFIG_TLS_KEY_FILE=

# The hosts section is used to define login information for the different targets.
# Hosts can be referenced either via their IP address or their hostname, as long
# as it matches the "target" parameter when scraping metrics.
#
# When the "target" does not match any host, the exporter will attempt to use the
# login information under "default".
#
# The default username and password can be configured using the two environment
# variables CONFIG_DEFAULT_USERNAME and CONFIG_DEFAULT_PASSWORD
hosts:
  default:
    username: user
    password: pass
  192.168.1.1:
    username: user
    password: pass
  host01.example.com:
    username: user
    password: pass

# The metrics section is used to select different groups of metrics.
# See the README file for a detailed list of metrics in each group.
# Each section can also be enabled using an environment variable.
metrics:
  processors: true  # CONFIG_METRICS_PROCESSORS=true
  system: true      # CONFIG_METRICS_SYSTEM=true
  sensors: true     # CONFIG_METRICS_SENSORS=true
  power: false      # CONFIG_METRICS_POWER=false
  events: false     # CONFIG_METRICS_EVENTS=false
  storage: false    # CONFIG_METRICS_STORAGE=false
  memory: false     # CONFIG_METRICS_MEMORY=false
  network: false    # CONFIG_METRICS_NETWORK=false
  oem: false        # CONFIG_METRICS_OEM=false

# The events section is used for filtering events when the "events" metrics group
# is enabled. Events can be filtered based on minimum severity and maximum age.
# Severity must be one of "ok", "warning", "critical"
events:
  severity: warning  # CONFIG_EVENTS_SEVERITY=warning
  maxage: 7d         # CONFIG_EVENTS_MAXAGE=7d
